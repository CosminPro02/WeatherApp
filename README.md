# ðŸŒ¦ Weather App

This is a simple Weather App that I built on my own to strengthen my understanding of React, API integration, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to practice working with external data, state management, and UI design.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
React â€“ for building the UI
Tailwind CSS â€“ for fast and flexible styling
Axios â€“ for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API
Moment.js â€“ for handling date and time formatting
âœ¨ Features
Search for the current weather of any city
Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
5-day weather forecast with icons
Simple and modern UI
ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This
I wanted to improve my ability to work with APIs, manage state effectively, and design responsive UIs using Tailwind. This project helped me get more comfortable handling real-time data and improving the user experience.
